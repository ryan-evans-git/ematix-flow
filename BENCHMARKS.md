# TPC-H SF=1 triangulation

Same-process bench: ematix-flow vs DuckDB vs Polars over all 22 TPC-H queries on SF=1 parquet data, 10 timed trials after 3 warmups, single-machine.

Source: `crates/ematix-flow-core/examples/tpch_triangulation_bench.rs` — feature-gated behind `--features triangulation`.

Data: `examples/tpch/data/sf10`.

Each cell is **median ms ± σ** across 10 trials. "—" means the engine couldn't parse / execute the query (dialect gap).

| Query | ematix-flow | DuckDB | Polars | Best |
|------:|------------:|-------:|-------:|:-----|
| Q05  | 237.05 ± 6.35 | 152.23 ± 2.64 | — | DuckDB |
| Q07  | 167.69 ± 11.34 | 152.86 ± 3.65 | — | DuckDB |
| Q08  | 241.01 ± 13.14 | 193.80 ± 4.67 | — | DuckDB |

## Wins

- **ematix-flow**: 0
- **DuckDB**: 4
- **Polars**: 0

## Caveats

- ematix-flow's late-materialization path (Π.10 `read_column_*_masked_into`) is enabled for `lineitem`. Late-mat helps queries with a selective filter on a dict/PLAIN-decodable scalar column (notably Q14); on aggregate-heavy queries with low filter selectivity (Q1) it's effectively a no-op.
- Polars's SQL frontend rejects several TPC-H canonical shapes: implicit cross-join in FROM, bare-column equi-joins, EXISTS subqueries, scalar-subquery comparisons, `SUBSTRING ... FROM ... FOR`, HAVING against unprojected columns. We ship hand-translated `q??.polars.sql` variants alongside the canonical `q??.sql` files (under `examples/tpch/queries/`); the bench feeds Polars the polars variant when present. Translations are semantically equivalent: explicit JOIN ON with qualified columns; scalar subqueries materialized as CTE + CROSS JOIN; EXISTS rewritten as semi-join via DISTINCT + INNER JOIN; SUBSTRING rewritten as SUBSTR(x, start, len).
- DuckDB runs at default settings (in-memory `read_parquet` views). ematix-flow runs with `target_partitions=14` and the InjectFusedQ1/Q3/Q5/Q6/Q12 + EnableDictGroupCount physical-optimizer rules registered.
