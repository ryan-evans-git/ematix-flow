# Benchmarks

Measurement notes + canonical baselines for ematix-flow's performance
gates. Subsequent PRs that touch `transform.rs` or upgrade DataFusion
re-run the relevant suite + diff against the baseline; any regression
≥10% needs a justification in the PR body.

Plan: [`docs/PHASE_SIGMA_PLAN.md`](PHASE_SIGMA_PLAN.md).

## Σ.A1 — TPC-H representative set at SF=1

The Σ.A1 audit-by-running anchor: Q1 / Q3 / Q6 / Q19 against
single-node DataFusion 53.1, reading Snappy Parquet from
`examples/tpch/data/sf1/`. Materializes results into `Vec<RecordBatch>`
so we measure execution wall-time, not just plan-building.

### Σ.A1 PR 2 baseline (2026-05-05)

Hardware: Apple M3 Pro, 36 GB RAM, macOS 15. SF=1 dataset = 320 MB
across 8 Parquet files (lineitem.parquet 202 MB, orders.parquet
52 MB, partsupp.parquet 39 MB, ...).

Method: criterion `sample_size = 10`, `measurement_time = 20s`,
warm-up 3s. Median of 10 samples reported with [low, high] from
criterion's bootstrap CI. Saved as baseline `sigma_a1_sf1_m3pro`.

| Query | Median | Range | Iterations | Workload shape |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Q1  | **48.7 ms** | [48.5, 48.8]  | 440  | scan + 10-aggregate group-by |
| Q3  | **34.6 ms** | [34.4, 34.7]  | 605  | 3-way hash join + ORDER + LIMIT 10 |
| Q6  | **18.2 ms** | [18.2, 18.3]  | 1155 | scan + filter + single sum |
| Q19 | **38.0 ms** | [37.4, 38.4]  | 605  | 2-way join + complex disjunctive WHERE |

### Σ.A1 audit findings

**None.** All four queries execute cleanly through DataFusion 53.1
with no SQL surface gaps. The Σ.A1 plan reserved a PR 3 for "fix
audit gaps surfaced by the benches" — that PR will be a no-op for
the representative set. Σ.A2 (dialect translator) + Σ.C (TPC-H full
22-query suite) will surface gaps the four representative queries
don't reach (correlated subqueries, certain CTEs, complex-type
literal forms).

### Comparison to PySpark — pending

Σ.A1 PR 4 lands the head-to-head comparison against single-node
PySpark 3.5 on the same hardware. Acceptance gate: DataFusion median
≤ PySpark median on all four queries (typically ~2–4× faster
single-node; if we lose, PR 4.5 investigates before Σ.A2 starts).

### Reproducing

```sh
# 1. Generate SF=1 data (~10s, 320 MB).
cargo run --release -p ematix-flow-core --example tpch_generate -- \
    --sf 1 --out examples/tpch/data/sf1

# 2. Run all four benches (~90s wall-clock with the defaults).
cargo bench -p ematix-flow-core --bench tpch

# 3. Run a single query for fast iteration:
cargo bench -p ematix-flow-core --bench tpch -- q06

# 4. Save / compare against a named baseline:
cargo bench -p ematix-flow-core --bench tpch -- --save-baseline mine
cargo bench -p ematix-flow-core --bench tpch -- --baseline mine

# 5. Tighten the measurement window for fast iteration / loose for CI:
TPCH_MEASUREMENT_TIME_S=10 cargo bench -p ematix-flow-core --bench tpch
```

If the data dir lives somewhere else, point the bench at it via
`TPCH_DATA_DIR=/path/to/sf1 cargo bench -p ematix-flow-core
--bench tpch`. Bench panics with a clear message if any expected
Parquet file is missing.

### When to re-run

- **PRs that touch `crates/ematix-flow-core/src/transform.rs`** or
  any of the `LazySqlTransform` / `DataFusionTransform` machinery.
  Compare against `sigma_a1_sf1_m3pro` if running on M3-class
  hardware; otherwise capture a fresh baseline on the PR's host.
- **DataFusion / arrow upgrades.** Any version bump in
  `Cargo.toml`'s `datafusion` or `arrow-*` workspace deps. Diff
  against the baseline; flag regressions ≥10% in the PR body.
- **Σ.B Ballista work.** Once a `BallistaBackend` exists, run the
  same four queries against it and report side-by-side. Σ.C lands
  the full 22-query head-to-head.

### Hardware variance

Numbers above are from M3 Pro (Apple Silicon). Linux x86_64
m6i.4xlarge baseline lands in Σ.A1 PR 4 alongside PySpark numbers;
expected within ~2× of M3 Pro on these queries.
