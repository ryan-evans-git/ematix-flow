## Wins

- **ematix-flow**: 0
- **DuckDB**: 1
- **Polars**: 0

## Caveats

- ematix-flow's late-materialization path (Π.10 `read_column_*_masked_into`) is enabled for `lineitem`. Late-mat helps queries with a selective filter on a dict/PLAIN-decodable scalar column (notably Q14); on aggregate-heavy queries with low filter selectivity (Q1) it's effectively a no-op.
- Polars's SQL frontend rejects several TPC-H canonical shapes: implicit cross-join in FROM, bare-column equi-joins, EXISTS subqueries, scalar-subquery comparisons, `SUBSTRING ... FROM ... FOR`, HAVING against unprojected columns. We ship hand-translated `q??.polars.sql` variants alongside the canonical `q??.sql` files (under `examples/tpch/queries/`); the bench feeds Polars the polars variant when present. Translations are semantically equivalent: explicit JOIN ON with qualified columns; scalar subqueries materialized as CTE + CROSS JOIN; EXISTS rewritten as semi-join via DISTINCT + INNER JOIN; SUBSTRING rewritten as SUBSTR(x, start, len).
- DuckDB runs at default settings (in-memory `read_parquet` views). ematix-flow runs with `target_partitions = std::thread::available_parallelism()` (override via `PARTITIONS=N`) and the InjectFusedQ1/Q3/Q5/Q6/Q12 + EnableDictGroupCount physical-optimizer rules registered.

## Wins

- **ematix-flow**: 0
- **DuckDB**: 1
- **Polars**: 0

## Caveats

- ematix-flow's late-materialization path (Π.10 `read_column_*_masked_into`) is enabled for `lineitem`. Late-mat helps queries with a selective filter on a dict/PLAIN-decodable scalar column (notably Q14); on aggregate-heavy queries with low filter selectivity (Q1) it's effectively a no-op.
- Polars's SQL frontend rejects several TPC-H canonical shapes: implicit cross-join in FROM, bare-column equi-joins, EXISTS subqueries, scalar-subquery comparisons, `SUBSTRING ... FROM ... FOR`, HAVING against unprojected columns. We ship hand-translated `q??.polars.sql` variants alongside the canonical `q??.sql` files (under `examples/tpch/queries/`); the bench feeds Polars the polars variant when present. Translations are semantically equivalent: explicit JOIN ON with qualified columns; scalar subqueries materialized as CTE + CROSS JOIN; EXISTS rewritten as semi-join via DISTINCT + INNER JOIN; SUBSTRING rewritten as SUBSTR(x, start, len).
- DuckDB runs at default settings (in-memory `read_parquet` views). ematix-flow runs with `target_partitions = std::thread::available_parallelism()` (override via `PARTITIONS=N`) and the InjectFusedQ1/Q3/Q5/Q6/Q12 + EnableDictGroupCount physical-optimizer rules registered.
